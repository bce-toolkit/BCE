BCE is a utility/library that can balance chemical equations. Visit our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/bce-toolkit/bce/wiki).

**From now on**, this project's maintainer is [LEXUGE](https://github.com/LEXUGE). And I'll transfer all the features into another [repository](https://github.com/LEXUGE/lib-xch-ceb). If you have any trouble when you are using BCE, just feel free to open an issue, and I'll support.

**BUT**, I will **NOT** add any new feature in this projects. All the new ideas will be implemented in [this repository](https://github.com/LEXUGE/lib-xch-ceb) and its related projects.
