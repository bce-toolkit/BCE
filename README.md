BCE is a utility/library that can balance chemical equations. Visit our [home page](https://bce.xiaojsoft.org/) and [wiki](http://git-private.xiaojsoft.org:5980/bce-toolkit/bce/wiki) (for internal developers only, public available at [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/bce-toolkit/bce/wiki)).  

  

**From now on**, this project's maintainer is [LEXUGE](https://github.com/LEXUGE). And I'll transfer all the features into another [repo](https://github.com/LEXUGE/lib-xch-ceb). If you have any trouble when you are using BCE, just feel free to open an issue, and I'll support.  

**BUT**, I'll do not add any new feature in this projects. All the new ideas will be impled in [this repo](https://github.com/LEXUGE/lib-xch-ceb) and its related projects.
